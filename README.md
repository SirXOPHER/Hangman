# Hangman

Hangman is a Java implementation of the classic paper and pencil guessing game.

### About this repository

This repository was mainly built as a personal exercise to improve Java coding, learn about the version control system Git and the web-based repository hosting service that is GitHub.

#### Prerequisites

To get this little game up and running on your local machine, for either fun or development and testing purposes, you need to have Java installed on your system.

#### Playing the game

There's currently no GUI implementation. This simple game will run on the console for now. Fire up your favourite IDE and simply run the main method of the program.

#### Running the tests

There is currently no implementation of a test suit for this program.

### Contributing

Feel free to contribute ideas, improvements or new features to this game. The way I see it, there is much room for improvement and there is still a lot to learn from a seemingly primitive game like Hangman.
